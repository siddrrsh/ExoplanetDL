# ExoplanetDL

Goal/Purpose: The purpose of my project is to reduce labor-intensive efforts required to screen for exoplanets (earth-like planets outside the solar system which may be promising for producing life). I will apply deep learning algorithms, specifically neural networks, to detect exo-planet candidates based on a web-scraped NASA dataset and an open-source Caltech dataset (can also be found on Kaggle).
